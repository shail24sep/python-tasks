Task 1 and Task 2
**TASK 1**

a = input("Enter the first number: ")

Prompts the user to enter the first number.

The input is stored as a string in variable a.

b = input("Enter the second number: ")

Prompts the user to enter the second number.

Stored as a string in variable b.

c = int(a) + int(b)

Converts both a and b to integers and adds them.

Result is stored in c.

d = int(a) - int(b)

Converts to integers and performs subtraction.

Result stored in d.

e = int(a) * int(b)

Multiplies the two integers.

Result stored in e.

f = float(a) / float(b)

Converts inputs to floats for division (to handle decimal results).

Result stored in f.

print(...)

Each line prints the result of a different operation with a label.


Output as expected:

Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 10
Addition: 15
Subtraction: -5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 0.5

**TASK 2**

Asks the user to enter their first name.

Stores it as a string in variable a.
